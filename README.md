# App Information

This App is designed to visualize data structures(DS) and algorithm's. It is currently being updated as I learn about new DS & Algorithm's.

I used firebase to host the app, originally it was hosted on Github pages. However Github pages does not provide support for single page applications.

You can access the application here - https://ds-algorithm-visualizer.web.app/

This app utilized asynchronous, higher order, and recursive functions to create unique animations for each DS or algorithm

Animations were created with Javascript & vanilla css

React components are styled using tailwindCSS
